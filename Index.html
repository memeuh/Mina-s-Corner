/*Welcome message along with paragraphs abt what i've done at ksu*/
<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I enjoy coding. So far I've only done some minor projects, but I still enjoy the process of coding.
  It's like solving a puzzle. I hope one day to be able to work on a big project.</p>
<h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
<p>I'm currently in the Tabletop Gaming Club at KSU. I have a D&D group with my friends, and it's a lot of fun. We're
currently playing The Curse of Strahd which is one of the most famous D&D campaigns.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I currently work at the Stinger's Dining Hall on Campus. My favorite part is getting to take food home since our
  dining hall is one of the best in the country. They also serve Cool Beans Coffee which is one of my favorite local
  coffee shops. They even have a blend specifically made for KSU. My coworkers are also nice and the management is good.</p>
